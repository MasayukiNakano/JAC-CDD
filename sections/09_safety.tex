\subsubsection*{In-chamber}
For the JAC installation, alignment work can be done with a low-power laser. Before entering the chamber, ensure that the power from the PSL is sufficiently low (<100 mW). 

Once the JAC is aligned and installed, a high-power test will also be required. Close all the flanges, monitor the inside of the chamber with a camera, and gradually increase the laser power. 

Maintain the LVEA laser hazard status throughout the entire installation process.

\subsubsection*{ISCT1}
We also need to align the ISCT1 table. As with the in-chamber work, the LVEA must be set as a laser hazard area. For the ISCT1 work, personnel must also be cautious of other beam paths, particularly the ALS-PSL path. This path is close to the JAC reflection path, and the power exceeds 1 W. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct the work with an expert familiar with the ALS-PSL path.
