\section{Wiring}
\subsection{Analog circuit}
The main circuit is the modulator and demodulator for the length and alignment sensing. These circuite will be located in PSL\_R1, PSL\_R2, ISC\_R1, ISC\_R2, ISC\_R4. Also, for tip-tilt actuation, we place the coil driver on SUS\_C4, and saterite box on SUS\_R1. The rack layout is working in progress.

\subsection{CDS}
- The model will run in l/h1imc or make new model l/h1jac?

\subsection{HAM1 flange feedthrough}
The main electronics in the HAM1 chamber related to the JAC will be
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3 x Tip-tilt suspension
    \item JAC Controls (PZT, thermometer, and heater)
    \item DC PD
    \item EOM
\end{itemize}
Each tip-tilt needs a D25 connection for OSEM sensing and control. JAC PZT, JAC thermometer, heater, and DCPD will share a D25 cable. Therefore, four D25 connections are needed. The EOM has four electrodes, and each connection will use a coax cable.

Summarizing these cables, the required feedthroughs are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 x dual-D25: \href{https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-D2000223}{D2000223}
    \item 1 x five-coax (Accuglass\_25D-5CX-450): \href{https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-D1600167}{D1600167}
\end{itemize}
